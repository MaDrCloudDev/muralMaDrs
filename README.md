### _Note: The Render mirror takes some time to wake up. Give it a minute. The primary version is hosted on Vercel, but is proxied through Cloudflare, and sometimes returns a bad gateway; requiring reload or resubmission._
## [Render mirror](https://muralmadrs.onrender.com/) 

A full-stack application I developed using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Node.js, EJS, Bootstrap, Passport, Cloudinary, & Mapbox - that allows users to find & review public art murals, or sign up & upload their own. CRUD & RESTful routes

Model-view-controller. Node-Express app, with Bootstrap components, EJS and CSS for templating. I added an example.env if you'd like to use this app, but updates will be limited, as I'm spending most my time on SvelteKit and T3Stack.

```
// set up .env
// DB_URL='MongoDB Atlas URL'

npm i
npm run start
```
